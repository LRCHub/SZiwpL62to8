I believed I could fly I could touch the sky
Not a shadow of a doubt in my mind aimed high
Made a plan, took a chance, so convinced I can
And fell flat crushing every dream I had

When there's no more hope
No return
When life falls apart
Crash and burn
I will falter and
I will crawl
Come back stronger I'm
Antifragile

It's the grit and the mud that defines my path
Disappointments telling me to raise the bar
Feel the burn and I know that it will take me far
Deep scars showing what I'm really made of

When there's no more hope
No return
When life falls apart
Crash and burn
I will falter and
I will crawl
Come back stronger I'm
Antifragile

I can take it
